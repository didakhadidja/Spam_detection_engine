# Spam_detection_engine
This Spam Detection Engine is a powerful tool designed to accurately identify and classify spam messages from a given dataset. The engine is implemented in Python and leverages the capabilities of various machine learning classifiers, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree.



1-Data Visualization: The engine includes data visualization techniques to gain valuable insights into the dataset's distribution and characteristics, facilitating better understanding and preprocessing.

2-Data Cleaning: A thorough data cleaning process is performed to remove noise, handle missing values, and standardize the text data. This ensures the input data is preprocessed and ready for classification.

3-Multiple Classifiers: The engine utilizes a variety of classifiers, including KNN, SVM, and Decision Tree, to evaluate and compare their performances. This allows users to choose the most suitable classifier for their specific use case.

4-Performance Metrics: The performance of each classifier is thoroughly evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive assessment of the model's effectiveness.
